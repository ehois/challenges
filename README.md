This is a place where I try to complete interesting programming challenges.

The primary focus will be to practice the fundamentals of Python (and maybe some other languages on the way).
Maybe some common algorithms and data structures will be implemented aswell (probably in anotehr project though).

One of the main sources of challenges (apart from old assignments from programmign classes) will be the r/dailyprogrammer subreddit at https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/ (or https://github.com/LewisJohnson/dailyprogrammer)

More infos about the subreddit here:

The challenges can be found here:
